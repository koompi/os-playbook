## About

We don’t define KOOMPI as a computer company. Instead, it’s a people-oriented technology and development project that keeps evolving. Though our notebook products are one of our proudest achievements, there is so much more we strive to accomplish. Before we get into the “useful” part of the book, let us take a look at how KOOMPI came to be what it is today and what we are working on.

Chosen as a symbol of knowledge and self-empowerment, the word KOOMPI derives from the Khmer phrase, "books or source of knowledge."

In ancient times, young Cambodian boys would leave home to learn and develop into adulthood at a buddhist monk monastery. All the books and learning materials given to these students were simply called KOOMPI.

Today, students in developing nations struggle to find adequate lesson plans, books, resources, and of growing importance, an internet enabled notebook for self-directed remote learning.

Only recently, modern computer hardware and satellite networks have become advanced and flexible enough for the extreme remote learning conditions of remote Cambodian villages.

We design KOOMPI to be affordable, lightweight, reliable, and energy efficient for low-power off-grid systems.
