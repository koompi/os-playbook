## Introduction to Arch Linux
Arch Linux is an independently developed, x86-64 general-purpose GNU/Linux distribution versatile enough to suit any role. Development focuses on simplicity, minimalism, and code elegance. Arch Linux can be installed from a CD image, USB, or via an FTP server. Its core system is always up to date with the latest fixes and new features after users run command updates to execute it.

This OS may seem difficult at first but it is a completely flexible distro in which users can decide which modules to use. It is the perfect platform for anyone interested in understanding how open source works as it requires users to pay attention to documentation and recommended usage tips throughout its usage. 

Arch Linux has its own vast library of documentation called Arch Wiki that contains an overview of *Arch Linux* and a description of what to expect from it: FAQs and facts about it, an installation guide, post-installation tutorials, etc. 

On the other hand, *Arch Linux user repository (AUR)*, a collection of applications and tools that can be installed on the OS but not yet available in the official Arch repository â€“  it is maintained by Arch Linux user community. **Pacman** is a command-line tool and the default package installer in *Arch Linux*.
