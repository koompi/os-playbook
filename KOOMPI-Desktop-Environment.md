# KOOMPI Desktop Environment 
Desktop Environment (DE) is the bundle of components that provide common graphical user interfaces (GUI) elements such as icons, toolbars, wallpapers, and desktop widgets. It shapes what the system looks like and how it interacts. 

KOOMPI Desktop Environment is based on KDE – a highly customizable desktop with moderate usage of system resources. It has its own set of integrated applications and utilities. There are three main desktop environments and each of them has two core theme colors, Dark and Light.

- **KOOMPI THEME:** The original theme of KOOMPI OS. It looks simple and clean. The taskbar is stationed at the top of the desktop.
- **KOOMPI MOSX THEME:** It looks similar to the KOOMPI Theme but it has a new feature called PLANK which allows you to pin your favorite applications on it.
- **KOOMPI WINX THEME:** This theme has two task bars, one at the top and another one at the bottom. When you click KOOMPI logo in the top taskbar, it shows the application list. If you click the bottom one, it shows a platform that allows you to search for applications.

You can set desktop environments through an application named KOOMPI Themes, located by default on the desktop screen. You can also search for it in the Application List. Although each of the themes has its own unique look, most of the modules are still used similarly.

Below, we will discuss various components of the KOOMPI Desktop Environment. 
## TASKBAR
The Task Bar is normally located on the upper border of the Desktop. The bar hosts many features as listed below:

### Start Menu
The Start Menu is located on the left corner of Taskbar and it can be accessed by the KOOMPI logo button. It displays all installed applications in the system in an organized manner by categorizing them into groups.

### Timetable
It is located near the right corner and it shows the time of the current location you have set. Clicking on it will enable you to see a drop-down of a calendar.

### System Properties
This section includes the hardware drivers such as Bluetooth, Audio Speaker, Micro Speaker, Battery, Night control, Connectivity, and many more as you can see at the right corner right next to Current Timetable.

*Info: For more information about those properties, **right click on each driver**.*

### Power Management
By clicking on the Shut-Down Button on the far-right corner of the **Taskbar**, future system actions such as *Log Out, Restart, Shut Down, Hibernate,* and *Sleep* will appear under the User’s Name Session.

### Others
“Others” refers to the current running services or applications. As a general rule, running applications appear next to the **Start Menu**, and the service running the app appears next to the **System Properties**.

### Widgets
Widgets are small gadgets or mechanical features that you add to your home screen like clock, dashboard, application launcher, and many more interesting and useful features. You can add which widgets you want for your home screen by **Right Click** on your Taskbar and then click **Add Widgets**. It shows many features of the widget for you to choose.

*Note: Taskbar can be moved to every corner of the desktop. Check Taskbar Configuration for more details*.

## PLANK
Along the bottom side of the desktop is the additional bar called the Plank, a feature mainly used for quick access to applications and a general overview of the desktop. Normally, it automatically hides and reappears whenever or as soon as the mouse cursor moves into its area.

---
## SEARCH BAR
In the middle-top of the desktop is the Searching bar which is also called KRunner Dialog. It is the field that can be used as a quick search for installed applications. Sometimes it does not show, you open it by **Alt + Space**.

### System Settings Categories and Modules
Here is a brief overview of all the categories and modules.
### **Appearance** 
Though there are only three Global themes, you can still do a lot more to your desktop. You can change your desktop using **plasma styles**, change the appearance of your **settings/tools**, and even the **text display** to any styles, sizes, and colors that is the most suitable for you.

*Note: Using all the dialogues above will overwrite any settings on your Desktop.* 

### **Workspace**
KOOMPI OS Desktop environments include extensive support for workspaces, which does not only allow you to organize your open windows onto different desktops but also as tools and features to manage the entire platform for a wide range of users use. It is compatible in a number of ways for you to configure on workspace and windows.  

#### Workspace Behavior

#### Bluetooth
Bluetooth is a technology that exchanges data between one device to other devices at a short distance through frequency using short-wavelength.

There are three main sections in this part:
1. **Devices:** You can connect, block, or set a limit to the device and all the details about devices (IP Address, Name...etc.).
1. **Adapters:** The configuration on a device that transmits and receives through bluetooth. 
1. **Advance Settings:** It is the extension option in Bluetooth for users to set the location of files when they receive it.

### Hardware
Hardware refers to the physical particles of computers and related devices. Hardware has two types which are internal hardware and external hardware.
1. **Internal hardware** includes motherboards, hard drives, and RAM (Random-access memory).
2. **External hardware** includes monitors, keyboards, mice (mouses), printers, scanners, and more.

Input Devices 
Input Devices here refers to the configuration of external hardware down below:
- Keyboard
- Mouse
