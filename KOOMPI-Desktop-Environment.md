# KOOMPI Desktop Environment 
Desktop Environment (DE) is the bundle of components that provide common graphical user interfaces (GUI) elements such as icons, toolbars, wallpapers, and desktop widgets. It shapes what the system looks like and how it interacts. 

KOOMPI Desktop Environment is based on KDE – a highly customizable desktop with moderate usage of system resources. It has its own set of integrated applications and utilities. There are three main desktop environments and each of them has two core theme colors, Dark and Light.

- **KOOMPI THEME:** The original theme of KOOMPI OS. It looks simple and clean. The taskbar is stationed at the top of the desktop.
- **KOOMPI MOSX THEME:** It looks similar to the KOOMPI Theme but it has a new feature called PLANK which allows you to pin your favorite applications on it.
- **KOOMPI WINX THEME:** This theme has two task bars, one at the top and another one at the bottom. When you click KOOMPI logo in the top taskbar, it shows the application list. If you click the bottom one, it shows a platform that allows you to search for applications.

You can set desktop environments through an application named KOOMPI Themes, located by default on the desktop screen. You can also search for it in the Application List. Although each of the themes has its own unique look, most of the modules are still used similarly.

Below, we will discuss various components of the KOOMPI Desktop Environment. 
## TASKBAR
The Task Bar is normally located on the upper border of the Desktop. The bar hosts many features as listed below:

### Start Menu
The Start Menu is located on the left corner of Taskbar and it can be accessed by the KOOMPI logo button. It displays all installed applications in the system in an organized manner by categorizing them into groups.

### Timetable
It is located near the right corner and it shows the time of the current location you have set. Clicking on it will enable you to see a drop-down of a calendar.

### System Properties
This section includes the hardware drivers such as Bluetooth, Audio Speaker, Micro Speaker, Battery, Night control, Connectivity, and many more as you can see at the right corner right next to Current Timetable.

*Info: For more information about those properties, **right click on each driver**.*

### Power Management
By clicking on the Shut-Down Button on the far-right corner of the **Taskbar**, future system actions such as *Log Out, Restart, Shut Down, Hibernate,* and *Sleep* will appear under the User’s Name Session.

### Others
“Others” refers to the current running services or applications. As a general rule, running applications appear next to the **Start Menu**, and the service running the app appears next to the **System Properties**.

### Widgets
Widgets are small gadgets or mechanical features that you add to your home screen like clock, dashboard, application launcher, and many more interesting and useful features. You can add which widgets you want for your home screen by **Right Click** on your Taskbar and then click **Add Widgets**. It shows many features of the widget for you to choose.
