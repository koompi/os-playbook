# Introduction to Linux

Developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991, Linux kernel is the heart of most open source operating systems today. Being the platform of choice to run desktops, servers, and embedded systems across the globe, Linux is considered one of the most reliable, secure, and worry-free operating systems available. 

Though you may not realize, Linux is actually everywhere; your phones, your thermostats, your cars, refrigerators, Roku devices, and televisions. It also runs most of the Internet, all of the world’s top 500 supercomputers, and the world’s stock exchanges. In fact, one of the most popular platforms on the planet, Android, is powered by Linux. 

Linux has a number of different versions to suit any type of user. These versions are called distributions (or, in the short form, “distros”). Nearly every distribution of Linux can be downloaded for free, burned onto disk (or USB thumb drive), and installed (on as many machines as you like).

### Popular Linux distributions are as follows:

- ARCH LINUX 
- ANTERGOS
- DEBIAN
- ELEMENTARY OS
- FEDORA
- LINUX MINT
- OPENSUSE
- SOLUS
- UBUNTU

## Introduction to Arch Linux

Arch Linux is an independently developed, x86-64 general-purpose GNU/Linux distribution versatile enough to suit any role. Development focuses on simplicity, minimalism, and code elegance. Arch Linux can be installed from a CD image, USB, or via an FTP server. Its core system is always up to date with the latest fixes and new features after users run command updates to execute it.
This OS may seem difficult at first but it is a completely flexible distro in which users can decide which modules to use. It is the perfect platform for anyone interested in understanding how open source works as it requires users to pay attention to documentation and recommended usage tips throughout its usage. 

Arch Linux has its own vast library of documentation called Arch Wiki that contains an overview of Arch Linux and a description of what to expect from it: FAQs and facts about it, an installation guide, post-installation tutorials, etc. 

On the other hand, Arch Linux user repository (AUR), a collection of applications and tools that can be installed on the OS but not yet available in the official Arch repository –  it is maintained by Arch Linux user community. Pacman is a command-line tool and the default package installer in Arch Linux.

### Here are the top 10 Arch Linux distros:
- Anarchy Installer
- ArchLabs Linux
- ArcoLinux
- Archman Linux
- Artix Linux
- Chakra
- EndeavourOS
- Manjaro 
- RebornOS
- VeltOS
