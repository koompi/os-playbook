## PIX

You might wonder if it is possible to use Windows applications on KOOMPI OS.
Here are two ways users can do so. 

- Installing Windows on a separate HDD partition: It means you have to dual-boot KOOMPI OS and Window OS. 

- Installing Windows as a virtual machine on current OS.

Though both of the solutions above work, they might affect your computer heavily. This is why we’d like to introduce you to ***pix,a sub primary command*** to **pi** for installing Windows applications and software on KOOMPI OS.

pix uses **Wine** to run *cross-platform applications.* **pix** is not only built to make window applications run but to improve the applications that are not running smoothly in pi.

Down here are some applications for the current pix version:
