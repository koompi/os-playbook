## How to Install/Uninstall an application on KOOMPI OS?
You can use **Discover and KOOMPI App Store** ***(available in the next version of KOOMPI OS)***  to install a number of applications. Users can also install apps with **baserunning** (Command-Lines).

KOOMPI encourages users to use command-lines in [**Konsole**]() to install and remove because we believe that learning software from the foundation adds more to users’ understanding about technology. On this operating system, pi (pacman) is one of our system’s primary commands. It is a powerful tool at the center of the system that allows you to maintain, expand, and update the system.

### What is Konsole?
Konsole is the default **terminal emulator** of the KDE Desktop environment. It runs **a command shell**, an application that executes the commands you type in.
On KOOMPI OS, you can access it through the **applications list** or **using the shortcut Ctrl + Alt + T** for instant access. This shortcut combination might be different on different operating systems.

### How do I manage my files on KOOMPI OS?
**Dolphin**, the default and main file manager of KDE Plasma Desktop Environment, is a lightweight file manager that allows you to manage your file exactly the way you want. Dolphin is quite full-featured, but the features are carefully chosen to optimize efficiency and flexibility for users.
Below, we list down some essential applications that are built-in with KOOMPI OS.
