## Introduction to Linux
Developed by **Linus Torvalds** in **1991, Linux kernel** is the heart of most open source operating systems today. Being the platform of choice to run desktops, servers, and embedded systems across the globe, Linux is considered one of the most reliable, secure, and worry-free operating systems available. 

Though you may not realize, Linux is actually everywhere; your phones, your thermostats, your cars, refrigerators, Roku devices, and televisions. It also runs most of the Internet, all of the world’s top 500 supercomputers, and the world’s stock exchanges. In fact, one of the most popular platforms on the planet, **Android**, is powered by Linux. 

Linux has a number of different versions to suit any type of user. These versions are called distributions (or, in the short form, “distros”). Nearly every distribution of Linux can be downloaded for free, burned onto disk (or USB thumb drive), and installed (on as many machines as you like).
**Popular Linux distributions are as follows:**
- LINUX MINT
- DEBIAN
- UBUNTU
- ANTERGOS
- SOLUS
- FEDORA
- ELEMENTARY OS
- OPENSUSE
- ARCH LINUX
