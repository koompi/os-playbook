WINE
Wine (“**W**ine **I**s **N**ot **E**mulator”) does not run as a virtual machine (simulating internal Window logic). Wine translates Windows logic to native UNIX/POSIX-complaint logic. In other words, Wine converts internal Windows commands to commands your system can natively understand.

There is a large number of Windows applications that are currently fully supported by ***Wine*** and will run without any hassle. New Windows applications are being developed every day. 

Though many of them would not function as well as we want on Wine at the moment, the development pace of Wine is also rapid. This means new applications are added very often.

In fact, there is a dedicated database for keeping track of them. There are almost 24,000 applications rated with different status depending on how well they run on Wine. 

|Status |Description |
|-------|:----------:|
|**Platinum**|These applications install and run flawlessly in our-of-the-box Wine.|
|**Gold**||These applications work flawlessly with some special configuration.|
|**Silver**|Applications with minor issues are tagged as Silver|
|**Bronze**|These have major issues that seriously affect usage.|
|**Garbage**|These simply won’t run on Wine.|

You can install wine using Konsole and the Installation Keyword **wine** .
