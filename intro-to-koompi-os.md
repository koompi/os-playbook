# Introduction to KOOMPI OS

KOOMPI OS is a lightweight, decentralized, crypto/security-oriented open source operating system derived from Archlinux. It is built on a kernel and provides an environment for multiple applications and software to run simultaneously. It means that users are granted special privilege that allows them to control everything on the system. 

KOOMPI OS is compatible with other software solutions and is especially great for individuals in the IT field. It gives users free usage without the hassle of licenses and can be customized to meet individual needs.

## KOOMPI OS Security 

The system itself leverages traditional OS security control to protect user data and system resources, protects device integrity against malware and provides application isolation – application is separated from the rest of the running processes. 

The robustness and security of the operating system is a result of the following aspects: 
Architecture strengths: structures are appropriated for the environment where it will run.

**Solid development**: a result of strong developer teams’ knowledge.

**Fast bug detection**: consists of how quickly flaws and errors are detected. 

## KOOMPI OS Security Threats

There are some characteristics that could compromise security. For example, the OS can be malicious if it is modified to have a different behavior from what was originally intended, making application security mechanisms fail. This only occurs when the users install the integrity of code against a hash signature (official signature). 

Last not least, KOOMPI OS is released under a license where others are allowed to study, change, as well as distribute the software to other people. 

## How can I install KOOMPI OS?

It can be installed on nearly any modern hardware and it also does not need as many hardware resources compared to other operating systems. 
Here are two ways to install KOOMPI OS (on KOOMPI notebooks and other laptops): 

1. __Create a bootable USB__:

    Get a USB minimum of 4GB. 

    Install the Etcher. 

    Download the OS source through this repo.koompi.org. 

    Move those sources into the USB and start making it a bootable drive. 

2. __Second Step (Setup OS into the PC)__

    Plug the USB to your PC.
