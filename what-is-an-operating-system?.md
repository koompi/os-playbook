# What is an operating system?

An operating system (OS) is the program that manages all other application programs in the computer. Without an operating system, a computer is practically useless. In other words, a computer’s OS (software) is the brain that runs the body (hardware). This does not mean that the computer’s hardware is less important. However, a compatible OS will ensure that your computer reaches its optimal performance. 

Outside of the personal devices, OSes are everywhere. Embedded operating systems are built into larger systems such as cars, traffic lights, digital TVs, ATMs, airplane controls, digit cameras, GPS navigation systems and even the elevators. 

### How does an OS work? 
Applications make requests to the OS through API’s (Application programing interface) so that users can interact with the operating system by command line or graphical user interface, often with keyboard or mouse or by touch. Operating systems are developed with different features to meet specific needs for the device it runs on. For instance, a desktop like LINUX works great on a large monitor, but would be cramped on a smartphone. 

### Types of operating systems
Most people use the OS that comes pre-installed with their computer, but it is possible to upgrade or even change to a different one. There are two types of software which are proprietary and non-proprietary.
- **Proprietary software**, also known as **non-free software**, or **closed-source software**, is computer software for which the software's publisher or another person retains intellectual property rights—usually copyright of the source code, but sometimes patent rights. The most well-known closed-source OS today are probably **Microsoft Windows and Apple’s macOS**.

- **Non-proprietary software** **(also called open source software)**  is a software that has **no patent or copyright** conditions associated with it. This type of software is publicly available software that can be **installed and used at no cost**. It also provides complete access to its source code. One popular example of this software is Linux. 

Below is some brief information about the three most prestigious operating systems of both types. 

#### **Microsoft Windows**
Microsoft created the **Windows** operating system in the mid-1980s. There have been many different versions of Windows, but the most recent ones are **Windows 10** (released in 2015), **Windows 8** (2012), **Windows 7** (2009), and **Windows Vista** (2007). Windows comes **pre-loaded** on most new PCs, which helps to make it the **most popular operating system** in the world. 

#### **macOS**
macOS (previously called OS X) is a line of operating systems created by Apple. MacOS is run on all Macintosh computers or Macs by default. Some of the specific versions include Mojave (released in 2018), High Sierra (2017), and Sierra (2016).

#### **Linux**
**Linux** (pronounced **LINN-ux**) is a family of **open source** operating systems, which means they can be modified and distributed by anyone around the world. Linux is **free** and has many different **distributions**—or versions—you can choose from.

### A Comparison 
macOS users account for less than **14%** of global operating systems—much lower than the percentage of Windows users (Windows 10 – 39.22%, Windows 7 – 33.38%). One reason for this is that Apple computers tend to be more expensive. However, many people do prefer the look and feel of macOS over Windows. Linux users account for between **1.74** to **2.18%** of global operating systems. However, most **servers** run Linux because it's relatively easy to customize.

### Why go open source?
- **Accessibility**: With open-source software, users can dig deeper, customize, and modify software by themselves to see how it works.
- **Affordable**: Since it’s an open-source software, there is no need for expensive licenses.
- **Security**: When there is a bug in the software, for example, any developer around the world can volunteer to maintain and fix it on time without needing any authorization.

As you may have known, KOOMPI OS is an open source suite that is derived from Linux. In the next pages, we will introduce you to Linux before going into a detailed manual for KOOMPI OS. If you are already familiar with using Linux, you may skip this section and dive right into the next chapter. 

### Popular open-source operating systems
Some widely used programs, platforms, and languages which are considered open source are: Linux operating system, Android by Google, and Open office. All free software is open source, but not all open source software is free. As KOOMPI OS is derived from Arch Linux, we will choose to talk exclusively about Linux and its various distributions before going into details about KOOMPI OS.
